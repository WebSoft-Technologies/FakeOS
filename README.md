#hello-world

This Is a simple HTML OS where you can't save anything. Things you can do are very limited like playing games. This is available for all OS and thanks for the downloads.
I also programmed this in intellij so if you want to get it, it's free and it's really good. also start at OS.html to start it correctly. The OS password is 1862 and make sure you extract all the files. V0.1.2
updates: bug fixes and 1 more app
